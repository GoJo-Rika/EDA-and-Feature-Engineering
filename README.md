# EDA and Feature Engineering

## Key Features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Introduction to Datasets**: A comprehensive introduction to the dataset being analyzed (Zomato, Black Friday, and Flight Price Prediction datasets).
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques for handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Use of visualization tools to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Libraries like matplotlib and seaborn are frequently used.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing summary statistics and other statistical methods to understand data distribution and key metrics.

### Feature Engineering
- **Feature Creation**: Strategies to create new features from existing data to improve model performance.
- **Handling Categorical Data**: Techniques for encoding categorical variables, such as one-hot encoding and label encoding.
- **Date and Time Features**: Extracting meaningful features from date and time variables, especially in the Flight Price Prediction dataset.
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Applying scaling techniques to standardize the data for better model performance.

## Usage

### Steps Followed for Each Dataset
1. **Dataset Introduction**: Overview of the dataset, including key features and the target variable.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the data, such as handling missing values and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using visualizations and statistical techniques to understand the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to enhance the dataset.
5. **Practical Coding**: Used Python and its data science libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) to demonstrate EDA on each dataset.
